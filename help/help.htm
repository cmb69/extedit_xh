<h1 id="extedit_xh">Extedit_XH</h1>
<p>Extedit_XH facilitates to have an arbitrary amount of so called “extedits”, i.e. content areas, which can be edited by users logged in via <a href="https://github.com/cmsimple-xh/memberpages">Memberpages_XH</a> or <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/register_xh">Register_XH</a>. That allows a very limited multi-user capability without the need to grant these users full administration authorisation. The plugin offers basically the same functionality as the One Page for simpleMultiUser plugin, but uses the editor of CMSimple_XH. For security reasons the file browser is replaced with a minimal image picker.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Extedit_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH. It requires CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.7.0 and PHP ≥ 7.1.0 with the fileinfo and session extensions.</p>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/extedit_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a> is available for download on Github.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins. See the <a href="https://wiki.cmsimple-xh.org/?for-users/working-with-the-cms/plugins#id3_install-plugin">CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Backup the data on your server.</strong></li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory <code>extedit/</code> to your server into the <code>plugins/</code> directory of CMSimple_XH.</li>
<li>Set write permissions for the subdirectories <code>config/</code> and <code>languages/</code>.</li>
<li>Navigate to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Extedit</code> in the back-end to check if all requirements are fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The configuration of the plugin is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in the back-end of the Website. Select <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Extedit</code>.</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Extedit_XH under <code>Config</code>. Hints for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.</p>
Localization is done under <code>Language</code>. You can translate the character strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available, or customize them according to your needs.
</p>
<!-- TODO: customization of the editor -->
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>To embed an “extedit” on a page, insert the following:</p>
<pre><code>{{{extedit(&#39;%USERNAME%&#39;, &#39;%TEXTNAME%&#39;)}}}</code></pre>
<p>To embed an “extedit” in the template, insert the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?=extedit(&#39;%USERNAME%&#39;, &#39;%TEXTNAME%&#39;)?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Note: if “extedits” are embedded in the template or a newsbox, the configuration option <code>Allow</code> → <code>Template</code> has to be enabled.</p>
<p>The parameters have the following meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>%USERNAME%</code>: The name of the Register_XH or Memberpages_XH user, who may edit the content. If <code>*</code> is given as username, <em>all</em> authenticated users may edit the content. Alternatively, you can specify multiple usernames separated by comma (without any whitespace) here.</p></li>
<li><p><code>%TEXTNAME%</code>: The unique name of the “extedit”. Omit this parameter to use the heading of the containing page. This parameter is mandatory, if you place the <code>extedit()</code> call in the template or a newsbox.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When authorized users are logged in, they are presented an <code>Edit</code> link, where they can edit the contents of the “extedit”. They can insert images via the editor, but have no access to the file browser – only a simple <a href="#image-picker">Image Picker</a> is available. In preview mode the admin of the Website is also able to edit the “extedit”, and has access to the file browser as usual. Visitors will only see the content of the “extedit”.</p>
<p>It is possible to have an arbitrary amount of “extedits” on a single page, all of them assigned to a certain user, each of them assigned to a different user, or a mixture thereof. To avoid that a user inadvertently overwrites the changes made by another user, a simple optimistic concurrency lock is implemented.</p>
<p>The contents of all “extedits” are stored in the automatically created subfolder <code>extedit/</code> of the current <code>content/</code> folder, each in a single file. The filename is made from the <code>%TEXTNAME%</code> by stripping all invalid characters (only alphanumeric characters and hyphens are allowed). <em>Therefore all respectively stripped <code>%TEXTNAME%</code>s have to be unique for each language of the CMSimple_XH installation.</em></p>
<p>Caveat: If you omit the <code>%TEXTNAME%</code> parameter, the heading of the page will be used instead. If you later change the page heading, the “extedit” file has to be manually renamed. Furthermore it is perfectly valid to have the same page heading more than once in CMSimple_XH in different subtrees of the TOC, but that does not work for Extedit_XH. So it is probably better to always explicitly specify the <code>%TEXTNAME%</code> parameter.</p>
<p>It is possible to use plugin calls in the “extedits” (what has to be enabled in the configuration), but this is of limited use, as the users will not be able to actually administrate the plugins. However, some plugins do not need such management, so they can be used ad hoc, and others could be prepared by the admin.</p>
<h3 id="image-picker">Image Picker</h3>
<p>As the filebrowser is only available for the administrator of the Website for security reasons, Extedit_XH offers a very simplistic image picker for users who are logged in via Memberpages_XH or Register_XH.</p>
<p>By default the user has only access to his own subfolder of the image folder (which is normally <code>userfiles/images/</code>). This subfolder has to have the same name as the user and must be created by the administrator. The user can upload images to this folder, but cannot delete or rename these images. Furthermore, the user is not able to access subfolders of his own image folder.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>The image picker is currently available only for TinyMCE, TinyMCE4 and CKEditor.</li>
<li>Advanced management of the “extedit” files (e.g. deleting and renaming) has to be done via FTP.</li>
</ul>
