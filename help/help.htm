<p style="text-align:justify">Extedit_XH facilitates to have an arbitrary amount
of so called "extedits", i.e. content areas, which can be edited by users logged
in via <a
href="http://frankziesing.de/cmsimple/en/?Welcome:Memberpages">Memberpages_XH</a>
or <a href="http://3-magi.net/?CMSimple_XH/Register_XH">Register_XH</a>. The
plugin offers basically the same functionality as <a
href="http://cmsimplewiki.com/doku.php/plugins/one_page_for_simplemultiuser">One
Page for simpleMultiUser</a>, but uses the editor of CMSimple_XH. For security
reasons the file browser is replaced with a minimal image picker.</p>

<h2 id="notice">Important Notice</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold">Extedit_XH couldn't be tested so far in various
environments. It is a so called beta version. Use with caution!</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Extedit_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH. It requires CMSimple_XH &ge; 1.6 and
PHP &ge; 5.3.0.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins. See the <a
href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation">CMSimple_XH
wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory extedit/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's plugins
directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions for the subdirectories config/, css/ and languages/.</li>
<li>Switch to "Extedit" in the back-end to check if all requirements are
fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
the website's back-end. Select Plugin &rarr; Extedit.</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Extedit_XH under "Config". Hints for
the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your
mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done under "Language". You can translate the character
strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available,
or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Extedit_XH can be customized under "Stylesheet".</p>

<section>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>To embed an "extedit" on a page, insert the following:</p>
<pre>{{{extedit('USERNAME', 'TEXTNAME');}}}</pre>
<p>To embed an "extedit" in the template, insert the following:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php echo extedit('USERNAME', 'TEXTNAME')?&gt;</pre>
<p>Note: if "extedits" are embedded in the template or a newsbox, the configuration
option Allowâ†’Template has to be enabled.</p>
<p>The parameters have the following meaning:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>USERNAME</dt>
    <dd>The name of the Register_XH or Memberpages_XH user, who may edit the
    content. If * is given as username, <em>all</em> authenticated users may edit the content.
    Alternatively, you can specify multiple usernames separated by comma (without any whitespace) here.</dd>
    <dt>TEXTNAME</dt>
    <dd>The unique name of the "extedit". Omit this parameter to use the heading
    of the containing page.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When the respective user is logged in, he's presented an "Edit" link, where
he can edit the contents of the "extedit". He can insert images via the editor,
but he has no access to the file browser&mdash;only a simple <a
href="#usage_imagepicker">image picker</a> is available.
In preview mode the admin of the website is also
able to edit the "extedit", and has access to the file browser as usual.
Visitors will only see the content of the "extedit".</p>
<p>It's possible to have an arbitrary amount of "extedits" on a single page, all
of them assigned to a certain user, each of them assigned to a different user,
or a mixture thereof.</p>
<p>The contents of all "extedits" are stored in the subfolder extedit/ of the
current content/ folder, each in a single file. The filename is made from the
TEXTNAME by stripping all invalid characters (only alphanumeric characters and
hyphens are allowed). <em>Therefore all respectively stripped TEXTNAMEs have
to be unique for each language of the CMSimple_XH installation.</em></p>
<p>Caveat: If you omit the TEXTNAME parameter, the heading of the page will
be used instead. If you later change the page heading, the "extedit" file has to
be manually renamed. Furthermore it's perfectly valid to have the same page
heading more than once in CMSimple_XH in different subtrees of the TOC, but that
doesn't work for Extedit_XH. So it's probably better to always explicitly
specify the TEXTNAME parameter.</p>
<p>It's possible to use plugin calls in the "extedits" (what has to be enabled
in the configuration), but this is of limited use, as the users will not be able
to actually manage the plugins. However, some plugins don't need such
management, so they can be used ad hoc, and others could be prepared
by the admin.</p>

<section id="usage_imagepicker">
<h3>Image Picker</h3>
<p>As the filebrowser (neither the default filebrowser nor external filebrowsers
such as hi_kcfinder) is only available for the administrator of the web site
for security reasons, Extedit_XH offers a very simplistic image picker for users
who are logged in via Memberpages_XH or Register_XH.</p>
<p>By default the user has only access to his own subfolder of the image folder
(which is normally userfiles/images/). This subfolder has to have the same name
as the user and must be created by the administrator. The user can
upload images to this folder, but can't delete or rename these images.
Furthermore, the user is not able to access subfolders of his own
image folder.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The image picker is currently available only for tinyMCE.</li>
    <li>The management of the "extedit" files (e.g. deleting and renaming) has
    to be done via FTP.</li>
