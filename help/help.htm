<h1>Extedit_XH&mdash;a CMSimple_XH Plugin</h1>
<img src="../extedit.png" style="float:left; margin-right: 1em">
<p style="text-align:justify">Extedit_XH facilitates to have an arbitrary amount
of so called "extedits", i.e. content areas, which can be edited by users logged
in via <a
href="http://frankziesing.de/cmsimple/en/?Welcome:Memberpages">Memberpages_XH</a>
or <a href="http://3-magi.net/?CMSimple_XH/Register_XH">Register_XH</a>. The
plugin offers basically the same functionality as <a
href="http://cmsimplewiki.com/doku.php/plugins/one_page_for_simplemultiuser">One
Page for simpleMultiUser</a>, but uses the editor of CMSimple_XH.
For security reasons the file browser is replaced with a minimal
image picker.</p>

<p><strong>Please do read this documentation, <em>before</em> you encounter any
problems!</strong></p>

<h2><a name="notice">Important Notice</a></h2>
<p><strong>Extedit_XH couldn't be tested so far in various environments. It is a
so called ALPHA version. Use with utmost caution!</strong></p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>Extedit_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH. It requires CMSimple_XH &ge; 1.6 and
PHP &ge; 5.0.0.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins. See the <a
href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation">CMSimple_XH
wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Backup the data on your server.</strong></li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory extedit/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's plugins
directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subdirectories config/, languages/ and the
plugin's content folder.</li>
<li><strong>Switch to "Extedit" in the back-end to check if all requirements are
fulfilled.</strong></li>
</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
the website's back-end. Select "Extedit" from "Plugins".</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Extedit_XH in "Config". Hints for
the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your
mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done in "Language". You can translate the character
strings to your own language, or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<!-- TODO: customization of the editor -->
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>To embed an "extedit" on a page, insert the following:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:extedit('USERNAME', 'TEXTNAME');}}}</pre>
<p>The parameters have the following meaning:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>USERNAME</dt>
    <dd>The name of the Register_XH or Memberpages_XH user, who may edit the
    content.</dd>
    <dt>TEXTNAME</dt>
    <dd>The unique name of the extedit. Omit this parameter to use the heading
    of the containing page.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When the respective user is logged in, he's presented an "Edit" link, where
he can edit the contents of the "extedit". He can insert images via the editor,
but he has no access to the file browser&mdash;only a simple image picker is
available. So the images have to be uploaded by other means. In preview mode the
admin of the website is also able to edit the "extedit" , and has access to the
file browser as usual. Visitors will only see the content of the "extedit".</p>
<p>It's possible to have an arbitrary amount of "extedits" on a single page, all
of them assigned to a certain user, each of them assigned to a different user,
or a mixture thereof.</p>
<p>The contents of all "extedits" are stored in the subfolder extedit/ of the
current content/ folder, each in a single file. The filename is made from the
TEXTNAME by stripping all invalid characters (only alphanumeric characters and
hyphens are allowed). <em>Therefore all respectively stripped TEXTNAMEs have
to be unique for each language of the CMSimple installation.</em></p>
<p><em>Caveat: If you omit the TEXTNAME parameter, the heading of the page will
be used instead. If you later change the page heading, the "extedit" file has to
be manually renamed. Furthermore it's perfectly valid to have the same page
heading more than once in CMSimple_XH in different subtrees of the TOC, but that
doesn't work for Extedit_XH. So it's probably better to always explicitly
specify the TEXTNAME parameter.</em></p>
<p>It's possible to use plugin calls in the "extedits" (what has to be enabled
in the configuration), but this is of limited use, as the users will not be able
to actually manage the plugins. However, some plugins don't need such
management, so they can be used ad hoc, and others could be prepared
by the admin.</p>

<h2><a name="limitations">Limitations</a></h2>
<ul>
    <li>The image picker is currently available only for tinyMCE.</li>
    <li>The management of the "extedit" files (e.g. deleting and renaming) has
    to be done via FTP.</li>
    <li>extedit() can't be called from the template.</li>
